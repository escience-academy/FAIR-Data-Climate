This lesson has been designed for researchers working in climate (related)
domains. Its main aims are to provide a more concrete, domain-specific
interpretation of the FAIR principles that have originally been formalated in
rather abstract terms; and to foster the discussion on how to move forward as a
field, for the implementation of the FAIR principles remains an ongoing effort.
